# An Explanation about my Different Programming Portfolios.
First of all, thank you for taking the time to look through my different programming portfolios.

As for why I have this many, well, when I was in High School my programming teacher assigned us to create a portfolio at the end of the school year using GitHub Pages.
The purpose of this was to collect all of our code from the year, store it, and display our favorite projects for any future employers to see.
I think this is a great way to see the progression of my coding abilities, and even though I am confused and slightly embarassed by my old coding methods, I find value in seeing how I've improved over the years.

Finally, how should you as a viewer browse these portfolios? My preference would be that you look at my latest portfolio which showcases some of my projects from my college classes.
Alternatively, you could start at my oldest portfolio and work your way through time to see how I have progressed.
Whichever way you view my portfolios, I hope you gain an understanding of my abilities, style, and creativity as a programmer.
