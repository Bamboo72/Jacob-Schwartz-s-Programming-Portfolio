# Welcome to Jacob Schwartz's 2021 Programming Portfolio

Email: jaschwartz27@gmail.com

Link to 2019 Programming Portfolio: [here](https://bamboo72.github.io/2019-Programming-Portfolio/)

Certifications: 
* Utah State Certified in C++
* Utah State Certified in Java
* Utah State Certified in Advanced Java

Also note that I was nominated as the 2020-2021 Sterling Scholar in Computer Technology for Skyline High School, and I made it to the Semi-Finals.
In December 2020 I made my Sterling Scholar Portfolio in which I included details on my computer technology skills, leadership, service, other interests, and the start of my personal "Choose Your Own Adventure" game project that I made at the beginning of the school year (approx. August 2020).

# Spotlighted Projects created in the Programming 2 class 2020 - 2021:
 
## First Semester Birthday Countdown
  
### Completed September 2020
 
 
 This project displays the days left until my family member's birthday. This was one of our first assignments that utilized Swing to create graphics, but it also utilized a Day class to handle the time until each birthday.

## First Semester Maze Solving Robot
  
### Completed September 2020
 
 
 This was the first textbook project I completed in Programming 2, and was the inspiration for my Individual Project. This project is able to determine if a maze is solvable or not. It originally used a maze created manually in a 2D array, but I later changed it to use randomly generated mazes.

## First Semester Text Chessboard
  
### Completed November 2020
 
 
 In this project I utilized 2D arrays and formatted print statements to display a chess board using special characters. I'm pleased with how the final display looks. This class could potentially be used for a text based chess game.

## First Semester Word Scrambler
  
### Completed November 2020
 
 
This project randomly scrambles words that the user inputs. This was a simple project, but it was good practice with Strings, for loops, substrings, chars, and randomization.

## First Semester Table Application
 
### Completed December 2020
 
  This project was another simple but interesting project that allows the user to pass in strings to a table and then display them. The strings are entered in CSV (comma-separated values) format. Hypothetically, this code could be used to create large tables for real data. (Although, I think much more development would be needed to make it usable.)

## Second Semester Inheritance with Pets

### Completed January 2021

 In this project I created a parent Pet class and three child classes: Dog, Bird, and Fish. The user is able to add, modify, and display the pets through a text based user interface loop. This project helped to show how to use inheritance and how to handle variables in the superclass and subclasses.

## Second Semester Guessing Game
 
### Completed February 2021
 
 This was a simple guessing game, similar to the one I made in year 1, but this time it can record the time users take to guess the number, and then record the user's name, time, and amount of guesses to a file.

Oh, and if you're wondering why this image is light themed while all the others are dark themed: I took this screen capture from the Mac terminal at school. I liked how the image showed off the formatting and it added some variety to the portfolio so I decided to leave it as the light theme. (Just if you were curious :P)
 
## Second Semester Permutation using Recursion

### Completed March 2021

 This was my second attempt at using recursion (The first being a small program for calculating numbers in factorial and fibonacci sequences). I am very used to an iterative approach to programming so this was a tricky concept to wrap my head around. With some help from peers I was able to get this code to work. This project asks the user for word and prints out all the permutations of the word using a recursive approach.

## Second Semester HashMaps Practice

### Completed April 2021

 Everyone in our Programming 2 class was assigned a collection type to focus on, and I was assigned to HashMaps. For the project I answered a series of questions about how to perform certain tasks using my assigned collection type.

## Second Semester Individual Project: Maze Game
 
### Completed March 2021
 
  This was an idea expounded from my first textbook project for this year. In this game you select the size of maze you want to complete and then use the mouse or arrow keys to navigate to the end. The graphics are displayed entirely using Swing. It's fairly simple, but gave me the practice I needed for the Year 2 Group Project. Fun fact, this project was initially meant to be incorporated into a dating sim game, but the project size was too ambitious for the time limit I had. I determined that the maze game alone would be a better individual project.

## Second Semester Group Project: The Isle of Laeso
 
### Completed May 2021
 
  This was the biggest project of Programming 2 class. I worked with three of my peers to create a Catan inspired board game called The Isle of Laeso. In this Viking themed game you customize your character, collect resources, build structures, and compete against the other players to win through three different methods: escape, kill, or ascend. I came up with the concept and thus was the project manager. I was also in charge of creating the game art and code for displaying the graphics, which turned out to be a bigger job than I originally anticipated. I made the graphics in Adobe Illustrator, and displayed the graphics using Swing.
  
  Link to the project GitHub page [here](https://github.com/Bamboo72/Programming2GroupProject1)
  
  Source code for the Graphics class I made [here](https://github.com/Bamboo72/Programming2GroupProject1/blob/main/src/Graphics.java)
  and note that I also made the [MousePressListener](https://github.com/Bamboo72/Programming2GroupProject1/blob/main/src/MousePressListener.java) and the [BuildMenuMousePressListener](https://github.com/Bamboo72/Programming2GroupProject1/blob/main/src/BuildMenuMousePressListener.java).
