# Spotlighted Projects created in the Programming 1 class 2018 - 2019:
 
## First Semester Timeline
  
### Completed October 2018
 
 
 This was both a research project and a challenge to create an interesting display to communicate information on some of the most notable early computers in history. In my project, additional information will be brought up when you hover over the text for one of the computers.

## Second Semester Number Guessing Game

### Completed March 2019

 Due to the limits C++ has with graphics, this is entirely text based. It's a simple but fun game where you try to guess a number in the least amount of guesses.

## Second Semester Recorded Questions
 
### Completed April 2019
 
 This was a simple app to help us learn how to work with files. All it really does is take the input from the user and record it for ten different questions.

## Second Semester Group Project: Bank System
 
### Completed May 2019
 
  This was a group project including all the students learning C++ in our Programming 1 class. Together we decided to create a banking system or automated teller. I was assigned the job of the bank system with deposits, withdrawls, recording the process, and keeping track of the balance of each user.
